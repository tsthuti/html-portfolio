<h1>The Best Movies According to Tanisha</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Tangled</h3>
<p>I used to watch this movie a lot when I was a kid. Rapunzel is my favourite Disney princess.</p>

<h3>Madagascar 2: Escape to Africa</h3>
<p>This movie holds a special place in my heart because Alex, the main character, finally gets to meet his family and experience life outside of a zoo.</p>

<h3>Despicable Me</h3>
<p>A classic. Watching this movie I woke up was a part of my daily routine at the age of 7. I could watch it forever and ever.</p>
